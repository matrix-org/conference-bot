    #  email            - TEXT(like) - The preferred email address for the person.
    #  matrix_id        - TEXT(like) - If known, the Matrix User ID for the person, otherwise null.

    #                 to check in before their talk starts.
    #
    #  host         - Someone who is moderating the talk itself in collaboration with the speakers
    #                 for the event_id. One host must check in before the talk starts, otherwise
    #                 the issue will be raised to the management room and coordinators will be
    #                 asked to take over. Hosts will get moderator in their talk's room, and be

    #
    #  coordinator  - These are typically people responsible for scheduling the auditorium's

    #                 talk rooms for their auditorium, though will only be invited to the auditorium
    #                 and backstage room (and the talk rooms on-demand if needed to fill in for a
    #                 missing host).

    #  conference_room     - TEXT(like) - The relevant room. This should match the event_id.
    #  start_datetime      - TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE - The start time of the talk. The timezone
    #                        is determined by the bot using the timezone elsewhere in this config.
    #  duration            - INTERVAL   - How long the talk is meant to last (start to end).

    #                                     bot will assume that presentation_length is zero and switch
